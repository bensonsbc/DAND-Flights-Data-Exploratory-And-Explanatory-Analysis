# Project: Flights Data Analysis 
## elaborado por: Alexandre Benson Smith


## Data set
>
The investigation analyzed the U.S.DOT data set for 2007 flights in the United States of America. The data set provides information on airline performance and flight delays. Contemplating scheduled nonstop flights within the United States comprising 21 airlines. The data set is available [here] (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7),
with the documentation available [here] (https://www.transtats.bts.gov). The data was analyzed, organized and cleaned to solve 6 quality problems. There are 7,275,259 flights in the data set.


## Summary of conclusions
>
- The "delayed" variable is a Boolean, tending towards the negative (not delayed). This is expected, as most airlines are assessed for delay by the aviation authorities.
- The number of delayed flights is less than the number of non-delayed flights over the months
- The percentage of delays increases between 9:00 pm and 0:00 am and one decreases considerably at 7:00 am.
- Saturday is the day with the smallest number of delayed flights.
- The percentage of delayed flights is slightly higher on weekdays.


## Main points of the presentation
>
- For the presentation, we decided to focus on factors related to time and its relationship with flight delays. Creating a bar graph with counts and their relative frequency. A stacked bar chart of delayed flights over the months.
>
We plot the Annual Flight Percentage per hour, day of the week and day of the week / weekend.


## Resources

The resources used for exploratory and explanatory analysis are detailed in each of the Jupyter Notebooks.
